# Customer Churn Analytics

This project was a group project completed in SFU's course **BUS445: Customer Analytics**.

We were provided five datasets, each containing key information pertaining to the fictional telecommunications company Telco, located in California. These datasets likely came from the website Kaggle.

The goal of the project was to use the programming language **R** to analyze the churn patterns this company was facing in Q3, and come up with business recommendations and actionable insights.

I have uploaded the slides we used for our presentation. These slides may be a good place to start to get a better understanding of the project, our findings, and recommendations.

## Scripts
- `data_preparation.R`: Prepares the data for data analysis and modelling
- `exploratory_data_analysis.R`: Explores each dataset and their varaibles relationship with customer churn
- Helper Functions
  - `BCA_functions_source_file.R`: A course-provided package to support the analytics we were learning in class. See [BCA package documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/BCA/versions/0.9-3) for more details.
  - `utils_graphing.R`: Functions to aid in the EDA process, producing visualizations and early modelling
